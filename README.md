# LearnOpenGL Text

Welcome to my LearnOpenGL repository! This repo is dedicated to documenting and showcasing my progress as I work through the LearnOpenGL text. My goal is to build a strong foundation in graphics programming. 

## About
This repository serves as a collection of projects and experimentation from the LearnOpenGL text. It's a work-in-progress as I progress through each chapter.

## Spinning Cubes and Camera
This is ultimate culmination of Part 1. Please view it in the "camera" branch!

## Progress
Currently, I have completed Part 1: Basics, which covers foundational graphics concepts.
* Rendering a triangle
* Shaders (texture and fragment)
* Textures
* Transformations
* Simulated camera

## Features
* Writen in C++
* Utilized OpenGL
* GLSL for shaders

## Building the Project
To run the project, you will need clang installed and please make sure you're running on a UNIX system! I have not tested this on Windows. The binaries for GLFW and GLAD are included in this repository, but they were built on my Macbook.

### How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Update the makefile to target file you want to build. You'll need to change SRCPATH and SRCNAME!
5. Build the project with make

## Acknowledgement
Thanks so much to Joey de Vries for creating this amazing piece of resource!
